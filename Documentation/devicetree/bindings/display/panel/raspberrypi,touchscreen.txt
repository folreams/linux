This binding covers the official 7" (800x480) Raspberry Pi touchscreen
panel.

This DSI panel contains:

- TC358762 DSI->DPI bridge
- Atmel microcontroller on I2C for power sequencing the DSI bridge and
  controlling backlight
- Touchscreen controller on I2C for touch input

and the binding currently covers the DSI display parts but not its
touch input.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Must be "raspberrypi,touchscreen"
- raspberrypi,touchscreen-bridge:
		Handle to the I2C device for Atmel microcontroller

Example:

dsi1: dsi@7e700000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	<...>

	pitouchscreen: panel@0 {
		compatible = "raspberrypi,touchscreen";
		reg = <0>;

		raspberrypi,touchscreen-bridge = <&pitouchscreen_bridge>;
	};
};

i2c_dsi: i2c {
	compatible = "i2c-gpio";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	gpios = <&gpio 28 0
		 &gpio 29 0>;

	pitouchscreen_bridge: bridge@45 {
		compatible = "raspberrypi,touchscreen-bridge-i2c";
		reg = <0x45>;
	};
};
